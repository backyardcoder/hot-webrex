# Hot Webrex
This repository serves as a barebone boilerplate to start a new app with Webpack, React, and Express stack. 

The sole reason for the existence of this repository is to capture and understand the very basic fundamentals of the frequently changing modern web development by going through the pain of configs (webpack) and understanding the nuisance of how things are working internally.

The existing boilerplates in the ecosystem are already very capable of starting a new project with a simple command, and I do use them quite often for my projects. 

*This project is simply born out of curiosity, and the hunger to learn things the hard way.*
